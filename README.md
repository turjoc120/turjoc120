# HOLA! 👋

  

I'm Turjo, a self-taught dev. I have a passion for problem-solving, Currently studying core CS fundamentals. ⚙️

  

I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others, I love to work with web technologies, and I like ReactJS for frontends and NodeJS for backends. I love open source. I am not a heavy contributor, but I really like to contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with. 🧙‍♂️ 


### 🌍  My Absolute Favorites:
-   💻 I love exploring new technologies and building cool stuff.
-   📰 Reading, writing & watching Tech Stuff whenever possible.
-   🍕 Tech Events & Hackathons.

When not coding, I'm probably reading books on philosophy, history, etc to feed my curiosity beast. 😴

  
Let's code some awesomeness! ✨
